# web client

Statser's web UI that is usually reachable at `http://localhost:8080/.statser/`
is written in [Elm][elm].


## Building

The project is a usual npm package built via [webpack][webpack] and can be
produced with [yarn][yarn] (my personal favorite) or vanilla [npm][npm].


### using yarn

```
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```


### using npm

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
